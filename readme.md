# Design Patterns Implementation 

In this project, I have implemented various design patterns to showcase their implementation and usage in real-life scenarios. The implemented design patterns include:

- Strategy Pattern
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- State Pattern

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is used when we have multiple algorithms for a specific task and we want to switch between these algorithms based on certain conditions. In this project, I have implemented the Strategy Pattern for a payment system where different payment methods such as credit card, debit card, and net banking can be used for making payments. The strategy pattern allows us to easily switch between these payment methods without changing the overall payment process.

## Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is used when we have multiple handlers for a specific request and we want to pass the request through these handlers in a specific order. In this project, I have implemented the Chain of Responsibility Pattern for a logging system where different log levels such as debug, info, and error are handled by different handlers. The Chain of Responsibility Pattern allows us to easily add or remove handlers without changing the overall logging process.

## Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is used when we have a set of steps for a specific task but the implementation of these steps can vary. In this project, I have implemented the Template Method Pattern for a pizza making process where the overall process remains the same but the implementation of some steps such as adding toppings can vary depending on the type of pizza. The Template Method Pattern allows us to easily modify the implementation of specific steps without changing the overall pizza making process.

## State Pattern

The State Pattern is used when we have an object that can be in multiple states and the behavior of the object changes depending on its current state. In this project, I have implemented the State Pattern for a traffic signal where the signal can be in three states: red, yellow, and green. The behavior of the signal changes depending on its current state. For example, the signal stays red for a fixed amount of time and then switches to green. The State Pattern allows us to easily add or remove states and modify the behavior of the signal without changing the overall traffic signal process.

## Conclusion

Overall, the implementation of these design patterns in this project showcases their effectiveness in solving real-life problems. By using these design patterns, we can achieve a more flexible, maintainable, and extensible codebase.
